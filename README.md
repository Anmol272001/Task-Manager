💡 **About This Project**

Task Master is a lightweight and efficient Task Management application built entirely with Pure Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. No frameworks, no libraries—just raw code.

The primary goal of this project was to master the core concepts of JavaScript such as DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, and LocalStorage. Building this without React helped me understand how frameworks work under the hood.

✨ **Features**

- CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update (toggle complete), and Delete tasks instantly.  
- Data Persistence: Uses localStorage so your tasks are saved even if you refresh or close the browser.  
- Dynamic DOM: Tasks are added and removed from the UI using JavaScript DOM methods (createElement, appendChild, remove).  
- Interactive UI: Clean design with hover effects and strike-through animations for completed tasks.  
- Responsive: Works perfectly on mobile and desktop.

🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- HTML5: For semantic structure.  
- CSS3: For styling and responsive layout (Flexbox).  
- JavaScript (ES6+): For application logic and state management.

🧠 **Why Vanilla JS?**

- Deep Understanding: I wanted to manually manipulate the DOM to appreciate what tools like React do automatically.  
- Performance: For simple tools, Vanilla JS is faster and lighter than loading a full framework.  
- Core Skills: Frameworks change, but JavaScript fundamentals remain the same.
